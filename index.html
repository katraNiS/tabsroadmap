        <h3>Vinyls</h3>
        <p>Vinyls (more accurately called vinyl records) are analog sound storage media: flat discs made from polyvinyl chloride
        (PVC), featuring a spiral groove that physically encodes sound, played on a turntable with a stylus that reads the
        groove to produce audio.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="CDs" class="tabcontent">
        <h3>CDs</h3>
        <p>Compact discs (CDs) are optical discs, typically 120mm in diameter, that store digital data like music, software, and
        images, using a laser to read microscopic "pits" and "lands" on their surface, revolutionizing audio playback by
        replacing analog formats like vinyl and cassettes with clear, digital sound</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="Merch" class="tabcontent">
        <h3>Merch</h3>
        <p>Compact band merch refers to smaller, portable, and often affordable items that fans can easily buy and carry, acting as
        tangible tokens of support and identity, like stickers, buttons, patches, guitar picks, keychains, and bandanas,
        contrasting with larger items like t-shirts or vinyl, and serving as great low-cost entry points for fans and revenue
        streams for bands.</p>
